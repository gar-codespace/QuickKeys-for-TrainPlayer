## QuickKeys
Richard Fletcher, 1942-2024  
This suite of TrainPlayer scripts is dedicated to the memory of Richard Fletcher, without whos help all subsequent work would not have happened.  
QuickKeys is a suite of TrainPlayer scripts that map train commands to the keyboard. The scripts are written in TrainPlayer Programming Language,  or TPL, TrainPlayers native scripting language. These TPL scripts are contained in standard txt files, and can be copied directly into Subroutines folder in the users TrainPlayer folder. The following are a set of YouTube videos that cover the use of these scripts.

### QuickKeys version 3
This is the 'main' component that links the other components together and provides language and help support.  
### SpeedSwitching  version 4
SpeedSwitching maps the keyboard to TrainPlayer train control commands. This is the component that 'drives' trains.  
Within SpeedSwitching is a component called PhakePhysics. This component extends the capabilities of SpeedSwitching by adding a set of controls not found in TrainPlayer. As its name implies, PhakePhysics adds mild physics simulations to the movement of trains. Additionally, keyboard keys are remapped to better simulate real train control functions such as throttle notch and automatic brake applications. This adds the same sort of challenge real engineers face to TrainPlayers layout environment.  
### DropKick version 3
This is another set of mappings that allows the operator to 'kick' and 'drop' rail cars in a manner very similar to real rail operations, and adds fun to basic switching operations. These functions are unique to this suite and are not found in TrainPlayer.  
### o2o version 3
o2o, or ops to ops, is a set of scripts which allows JMRI, the Java Model Railroad Interface to be used as the operations engine for TrainPlayer. All of the features of JMRI Operations Pro are leveraged by these scripts, and are implemented through TrainPlayer's Advanced Ops interace. On the JMRI side, my Pattern Scripts plugin is used to facilitate the use of JMRI with TrainPlayer.  
### RandomRoads version 2
The RandomRoads subroutine is a utility tha relabels rolling stock on a layout from TraimPlayers functional nomenclature into something more 'railroady'. This sunroutine is configured via an Ops Central note. Users have control over which rolling stock
gets relabeled and the road names the rolling stock gets relabeled to. This subroutine enhances the display of Advanced Ops features.  
### TurnTable version 2
This component extends TrainPlayers control of turntables and transfer tables. By using the keyboard, a turntables bridge can easily be aligned to any stall or approach track.  
### JobTimer version 1
This script is started when a user begins switching and is ended when the switching event is completed. Both total moves and total time are scored. It originated as a companion script to John Allen's Time Saver switching puzzle.
